#Spam News Detection system using a Python AI tool

Overview: 

This project implements a spam detection system using machine learning techniques. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) to classify news articles as either fake or true. The dataset consists of two CSV files: one containing true news articles and the other containing fake news articles.


Requirements:

To run this code, you need the following Python libraries:


numpy
pandas
nltk
sklearn
You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas nltk scikit-learn
Dataset
test.csv: Contains fake news articles labeled as 1.
True.csv: Contains true news articles labeled as 0.
Usage
Load the Data: The first step involves loading the datasets and assigning labels to each type of news.

python
Copy code
Fake_news = pd.read_csv("test.csv")
True_news = pd.read_csv("True.csv")
True_news["label"] = 0
Fake_news["label"] = 1
Combine Datasets: The true and fake news datasets are combined into a single dataset for analysis.

python
Copy code
dataset1 = True_news[["text", "label"]]
dataset2 = Fake_news[["text", "label"]]
dataset = pd.concat([dataset1, dataset2])
Data Preprocessing: The text data is cleaned by converting to lowercase, removing non-alphabetic characters, and eliminating stopwords. Lemmatization is also applied to reduce words to their base forms.

python
Copy code
def clean_row(row):
    # Cleaning process
    ...
dataset['text'] = dataset['text'].apply(lambda x: clean_row(x))
Feature Extraction: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is used to transform the cleaned text data into numerical features.

python
Copy code
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=50000, lowercase=False, ngram_range=(1, 2))
vec_train_data = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_data)
Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

python
Copy code
train_data, test_data, train_label, test_label = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)
Model Training (Not Included)

This code snippet does not include the actual model training and evaluation steps. You can proceed with training a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) using the vec_train_data and train_label, followed by evaluation on the vec_test_data.


Notes:

Ensure you have the nltk stopwords and WordNet lemmatizer downloaded by running the following commands:

python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download("stopwords")
nltk.download("wordnet")
Adjust the parameters in the TfidfVectorizer or the preprocessing steps to optimize the performance of your spam detection model.


Conclusion:

This project serves as a foundation for building a spam detection system. You can expand upon it by implementing various machine learning algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, and improving preprocessing techniques to enhance accuracy.
